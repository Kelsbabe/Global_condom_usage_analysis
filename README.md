# Global_condom_usage_analysis
 A comprehensive analysis of global condom usage, aimed at supporting public health strategies and awareness efforts. It focuses on various countries including South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Germany, Brazil, China, and Japan. 
This dataset unveils the global narrative of contraceptive use, highlighting market trends and the broader impact on public health across various countries. It sheds light on which condom brands dominate specific markets, how sales have evolved over time, and the influence of government-led campaigns in promoting safe sex practices.
Through the lens of this data, we gain insights into the effectiveness of sex education, fluctuations in teen pregnancy rates, and the progress of HIV prevention efforts. Altogether, these findings play a vital role in shaping reproductive health policies and guiding future public health interventions.

## Project Overview

Before diving into the visualizations, we categorized the dataset into:

### Category 1: Independent Variables
These values can stand alone in analysis:
Country
Most popular condom type
Brand dominance
Percentage of male users
Percentage of female users

### Category 2: Dependent Variables
These rely on Category 1 for context:
Year
Total quantity sold
Market revenue
Government campaigns
Awareness levels
Sex education rates
Contraceptive usage rate
Teen pregnancy rate
HIV prevention awareness
Online sales
Sales per condom type
